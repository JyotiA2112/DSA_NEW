An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers with a definite pattern. If you take any number in the sequence then subtract it from the previous one, the difference is always a constant.

A good arithmetic sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of either 1 or -1.

For example, [4, 5, 6] is a good arithmetic sequence. So is [6, 5, 4], [10, 9], or [-3, -2, -1]. But, [1, 2, 1] (no common difference) or [3, 7] (common difference is 4) is NOT.
Implied, any sequence that has only one element is a good arithmetic sequence.

For example, [4] is a good arithmetic sequence.
Given an integer array nums, return the sum of the sums of each subarray that is a good arithmetic sequence.

Example:

Given nums = [7, 4, 5, 6, 5]. Each of the following subarrays is a good arithmetic sequence:

public class GoodSubArray {
